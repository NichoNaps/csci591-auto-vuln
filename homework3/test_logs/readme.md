This folder contains subfolders with tests of the symbolic interpreter.

Each subfolder is layed out as follows:
- `<foldername>.c` This is the input C code used for this test.
- `image.png` This is the plotted graph of symbolic state for that C file.
- `stdout.log` This is the stdout of the symbolic interpreter for that C file.

real_test is a test that uses the C example provided in the assignment 3 rubric.
